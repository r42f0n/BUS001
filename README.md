BUS001 Coursework Assignment: 80%   Individual   Essay
Due date:                     TBD
Submission:          QMPLUS Turnitin
Please follow submission   instructions and guidelines
Word Count:         1500-up to 2000 words (references excluded)
QMUL SBM policy allows for students to   submit   a word   count   5%   above the word count or 5%   below the required word   count.
Be   mindful   that exceeding   well   beyond the word count does not equal   to   better work!   It   is good academic discipline to stay within the required word   count.
References:          As an academic assessment, you are   required to   use appropriate
resources. You must include academic resources, which   also   entail   module   readings.
You   may also   provide supporting evidence from reputable reports (e.g.,
Government   websites, Case studies,   News   Reports, i.e., The
Guardian).   Websites   like mindtools.com, Wikipedia, etc., will not   be acceptable   sources for this assignment.
Please   use   Harvard   Referencing Style.
AI-Assistance: You may use AI to draft text and   refine your work,   i.e.,   proofreading,
grammar, etc. Your final submission should show   how you have   developed   and   refined these   ideas. You must critically evaluate and modify   any   AI-generated            content you   use.
Tips:                                           You   are   expected   to   submit   individual   independent   work.
Please construct an academic essay   using appropriate   language, style,   structure,   and   referencing.
